Security Strategy for the PWA Task Manager
This document outlines a multi-faceted security strategy designed to proactively mitigate vulnerabilities and establish a continuous management process for the PWA Task Manager project. The strategy is specifically tailored to leverage the modularity and declarative nature of the Concepts + Synchronizations architecture.

A. Proactive CVE Mitigation Strategy
This section details the proactive measures to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced into the codebase or its dependencies.

1. Dependency Hygiene Policy
Mandate: The project will adhere to a strict "minimalist dependency" policy. New npm dependencies will only be approved if they are actively maintained (last commit < 6 months, > 1 maintainer), have a strong community reputation, and provide a clear benefit that outweighs the cost of building a minimal in-house solution. All dependencies must have a clear license compatible with the project's goals.
Tooling:
npm audit: An npm audit --audit-level=high check will be integrated into a pre-commit hook and the CI/CD pipeline. Builds will fail if any high or critical severity CVEs are detected in dependencies.
Dependabot: GitHub's Dependabot will be enabled on the repository to automatically scan for outdated dependencies and create pull requests for security updates, providing a constant, low-effort stream of security patches.
2. Architectural Leverage
The Concepts + Synchronizations pattern provides a significant security advantage by enforcing modularity and explicit data flow, which we will leverage for security auditing:

Limited Blast Radius: Vulnerabilities are naturally contained within a single Concept. For example, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in a library used by uiRenderer.js cannot directly access the storage logic within storageSync.js. Its impact is limited to corrupting the rendered view.
Auditable Attack Surface: Because all cross-concept interactions are declared in synchronizations.js, the attack surface is explicit. To audit for data-related vulnerabilities, an auditor can focus solely on the events that trigger actions in storageSync.js and the pure functions within that Concept, dramatically reducing review time compared to a monolithic application.
Isolation of Side Effects: All high-risk operations (DOM manipulation, IndexedDB I/O, network requests) are isolated in specific Concepts (uiRenderer.js, storageSync.js, etc.). This allows security controls and reviews to be concentrated on these few, well-defined modules.
3. Secure Coding Principles
Given the PWA/Client-side deployment environment, the following three risks are paramount. All code reviews and AI-generated code must address them.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Standard: All data originating from a Concept's state (e.g., taskManager.state.tasks) that is passed to uiRenderer.js for rendering must be treated as untrusted. The pure rendering functions within uiRenderer.js must escape HTML entities by default or use textContent instead of innerHTML for dynamic data.
Insecure Data Storage:
Standard: The storageSync.js Concept must not store sensitive information (e.g., passwords, tokens) in IndexedDB without encryption. All data retrieved from storage must be validated before being passed to other Concepts, as stored data could be tampered with by other malicious scripts on the same origin.
Input Validation:
Standard: The pure functions at the boundary of each Concept (e.g., createTask in taskManager.js) are the primary line of defense. They are responsible for validating and sanitizing all external inputs (e.g., user-provided task titles) before they are incorporated into the application's state.
B. Continuous Vulnerability Management & Response Plan
This section outlines the ongoing process for identifying, prioritizing, and resolving security vulnerabilities in a timely and architecturally-sound manner.

1. Continuous Scanning & Reporting
Frequency:
Per-Push: The CI pipeline will run npm audit on every push to any branch.
Daily: Dependabot will perform a daily scan of all dependencies and automatically create PRs for patches.
Metric: The primary security health metric is: "Zero High or Critical-Severity CVEs in package.json on the main branch." This provides a clear, measurable, and non-negotiable goal for the development team.
2. Prioritization & Triage
Newly discovered CVEs will be triaged using a combination of CVSS score and architectural context:

Initial Assessment: A CVE with a CVSS score of 7.0+ (High/Critical) is automatically considered a high-priority issue.
Contextual Analysis (Blast Radius): The priority is escalated or de-escalated based on which Concept is affected.
Critical Priority: A vulnerability in a dependency used by a Concept handling sensitive data or core I/O (e.g., storageSync.js, authManager.js).
High Priority: A vulnerability in a Concept that handles user input or rendering (e.g., taskManager.js, uiRenderer.js).
Medium Priority: A vulnerability in a Concept with purely internal logic and no direct I/O (e.g., progressTracker.js).
Low Priority: A vulnerability in a devDependency not present in the production build.
3. Mitigation & Refactoring Strategy (The AI-Driven Fix)
When a vulnerability is prioritized for a fix, the following repeatable, AI-assisted plan will be executed to ensure the fix is secure and architecturally compliant.

Isolation: The first step is to identify the exact Concept module that uses the vulnerable dependency or contains the flawed code. All changes will be confined to this Concept and its corresponding test file.
Mitigation: A fix is proposed. This is typically a dependency upgrade in package.json or a code change within a Concept's pure function (e.g., adding input sanitization).
Verification: This step is mandatory. The AI must add a new unit test to the Concept's test file (/tests/<conceptName>.test.js) that specifically reproduces the vulnerability and then proves the fix has resolved it. This test serves as non-regression proof for the future.
Example AI Task Prompt:
"A high-severity XSS vulnerability (CVE-2023-1234) was found in the markdown-renderer library used by the uiRenderer.js Concept. Generate a fix that isolates the vulnerability by upgrading the dependency in package.json. Then, add a new unit test to /tests/uiRenderer.test.js that passes a malicious string like <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> to the rendering function and asserts that the output is properly sanitized HTML, adhering to the Testability principle in agenticDevlopment.md."
